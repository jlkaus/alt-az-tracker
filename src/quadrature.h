// Managing a set of input pins (including interrupts) for a single
// set of quadrature patterns.
// Need to handle angular linear and angular rotary, to start, with origin marks.
// May also want to handle continuous variants, where the counter doesn't restart after 360 degrees.
// For the linear form, may also want to handle a positional rather than angular variant.
// Parameters would be distance/angular distance between mark sequences, pin numbers, whether
// there is an origin input, etc.
